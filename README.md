# Quick look into DECENT

## The new way of publishing

 Our intention is to revolutionize digital distribution across the Internet.

 DECENT Network is a content distribution platform that is decentralized,
 open-source and uses Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology guarantees
 trust and security by embedding encryption at the lowest level.
 Perhaps the greatest benefit of this implementation of blockchain technology
 is invariant storage for published content which can eliminate manipulation
 and influence by any sort of middleman (eg. publisher). In short content can
 now be created and delivered directly with any fees collected solely by
 the seller at the point of sale. In addition to the technological side,
 there are the economical and social protocols that will govern real-world
 interactions across the network. In order to make transactions viable and
 user friendly a crypto-token, the DCT, has been implemented. The encrypted
 DCT tokens help mitigate attacks, promote funding and ensure transaction
 validation. One last thing of note, unlike other content distribution platforms
 underdevelopment, there are virtually no limitations as to the type of media that
 can be published on DECENT Network. It could be songs, books, articles, videos,
 source code, or anything really and in almost any format.
